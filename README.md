# grail.js
A javascript module to auto-generate a scheduling chart from a number of predefined inputs. 

Grail focuses on allowing target dates and prerequisite dates for the data to give you a better visual look at how you're doing.

## Target Dates
Grail allows you to input target dates for your schedule. This reflects when you want the item to be finished by. The color of the item on the chart will change in response to this date - if you're likely to hit it, miss it, or be early.

## Prereq Dates
Prerequisite Dates are dates that must come to pass before the item can start. These are optional - you may have up to three dates set in this manner.
